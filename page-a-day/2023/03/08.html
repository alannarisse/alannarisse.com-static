      <aside>Today I went to Corvalis to see <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/jeffry-mitchell" target="_blank">Jeffry Mitchell</a> talk about his show at the <a href="https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/svpda/art/community/art-galleries-fairbanks-hall/fairbanks-gallery-art" target="_blank">Fairbanks Gallery at OSU</a>. His show is entitled "This Compost" after this Walt Whitman poem. He read this poem and talked about his work. I wanted to remember this poem and read through it multiple times.</aside>
      <h1>This Compost</h1>
      <h2>Walt Whitman</h2>
      <p>
        Something startles me where I thought I was safest,<br />
        I withdraw from the still woods I loved,<br />
        I will not go now on the pastures to walk,<br />
        I will not strip the clothes from my body to meet my lover the sea,<br />
        I will not touch my flesh to the earth as to other flesh to renew me.
      </p>

      <p>
        O how can it be that the ground itself does not sicken?<br />
        How can you be alive you growths of spring?<br />
        How can you furnish health you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?<br />
        Are they not continually putting distemper'd corpses within you?<br />
        Is not every continent work'd over and over with sour dead?
      </p>

      <p>
        Where have you disposed of their carcasses?<br />
        Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations?<br />
        Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?<br />
        I do not see any of it upon you to-day, or perhaps I am deceiv'd,<br />
        I will run a furrow with my plough, I will press my spade through the sod and turn it up underneath,<br />
        I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behold this compost! behold it well!<br />
        Perhaps every mite has once form'd part of a sick personâ€”yet behold!<br />
        The grass of spring covers the prairies,<br />
        The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,<br />
        The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,<br />
        The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,<br />
        The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,<br />
        The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree,<br />
        The he-birds carol mornings and evenings while the she-birds sit on their nests,<br />
        The young of poultry break through the hatch'd eggs,<br />
        The new-born of animals appear, the calf is dropt from the cow, the colt from the mare,<br />
        Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's dark green leaves,<br />
        Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk, the lilacs bloom in the dooryards,<br />
        The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour dead.
      </p>

      <p>
        What chemistry!<br />
        That the winds are really not infectious,<br />
        That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea which is so amorous after me,<br />
        That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked body all over with its tongues,<br />
        That it will not endanger me with the fevers that have deposited themselves in it,<br />
        That all is clean forever and forever,<br />
        That the cool drink from the well tastes so good,<br />
        That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy,<br />
        That the fruits of the apple-orchard and the orange-orchard, that melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none of them poison me,<br />
        That when I recline on the grass I do not catch any disease,<br />
        Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once a catching disease.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now I am terrified at the Earth, it is that calm and patient,<br />
        It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,<br />
        It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless successions of diseas'd corpses,<br />
        It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,<br />
        It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,<br />
        It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from them at last.
