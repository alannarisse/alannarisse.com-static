        <h1>The Women of Bauhaus</h1>
        <p>Bauhaus opened it's doors in Weimar Germany by German architect Walter Gropius in 1919. This was in the wake of World War I. It was an extremely progressive school at the time, believing men and women were equal. It was the only art school at the time that admitted women. Bauhaus was shut down by the nazi's in 1933. The school's vision was to reimagine the world by unifying the arts.</p>
        <p>It's important to state that even though the school was progressive for the time, there was still plenty of mysogeny afoot, some women being discouraged from some arts and directed towards more "feminine" arts. However, It's pretty amazing that several women were able to acheive greatness in architecture, metalworking, and sculpture, all fields that are sadly STILL considered "masculine" arts.</p>
